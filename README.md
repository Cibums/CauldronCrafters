**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Date Released:** 2024-04-15
**Developed for:** Ludum Dare 55

Players step into the shoes of a shop owner who crafts custom monsters for various customer needs. Players summon these monsters by strategically placing items into a cauldron in a specific order, where each ingredient modifies the monster's traits. The correct sequence is essential to meet customer specifications.

Mistakes in the summoning process require starting over. As the shop grows, the player unlocks more items, and customers have new demands, challenging players to refine their strategy and memory skills.

## Known Issues
- Sometimes items are unlocked for seemingly no reason. The actual reason is that there are too few customers added to the game, and therefore sometimes the game will have to unlock some items for you, to even give you a customer that asks for something that isn't impossible to give them
- Text in the information popup is outside of the UI if too long
